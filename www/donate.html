      <h1>FireFTP Charity Project</h1>
      or: we're all in this thing together<br><br>
      <h3>Where does this money go?</h3>
        <i><b>All proceeds</b></i> go towards helping support worldwide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a> rights.  With your kind help, we can assist in making <a href="http://www.itgetsbetter.org/">things get better</a>.  In particular, donations will go to supporting support gay rights groups in the U.S, Croatia, and Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.  In addition, this years proceeds will also benefit a domestic violence shelter in Portland, Oregon.<br/>
      <h3>What's a reasonable donation?</h3>
        Even $1 is enough to show your appreciation - give what you can.  Most FTP programs run about $40 US dollars, so you are getting quite a bargain here... :-)  If you are a business, using FireFTP for professional endeavors, you should consider donating at least $20.  If you are using several copies of the program in your company you should perhaps pay an additional $5 for each copy.  In the end, pay what you feel is fair.<br/>
      <h3>I have no money right now - what else can I do?</h3>
        You, yes <b>you</b>, can be just a positive influence, if not more by helping out right where you are, in your local community.<br/><br/>
        
        <i>Suggestions on different ways of being awesome:</i><br/>
        Volunteer.  Somewhere.  Anywhere.<br/>
        Take what you're passionate about and see how you can also make it beneficial to your community.<br/>
        If you own a business, donate proceeds to green energy or charity or something beneficial.<br/>
        Support local businesses and encourage them to do the above.<br/>
        Buy locally grown food and get a reusable bag.<br/>
        Ride your bike instead of taking your car.<br/>
        Go hang out with your kids more.<br/>
        Go hang out with your parents more.<br/>
        Take only what you need, not what you can get.<br/><br/>

        So, in conclusion, as <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/06/061906.html">Ze Frank</a> would say: just be awesome.
        <br/>
      <h3>What if I don't like that you're supporting the gay and lesbian community?</h3>
        I've led the FireFTP charity project for over 7 years now and I feel both blessed and humbled by the overwhelming generosity that I've received from the worldwide community.  For 7 years I organized it so that half of what was donated went to orphanages in Sarajevo and Croatia while the other half put bread on my table.  I find myself, once again very blessed to be starting a job with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and, as such, have upped the ante to not just give 50% but 100% of proceeds to charity.<br><br>
        
        In a sense, it's somewhat easy to ask for donations for an orphanage since one immediately has a sense of pathos towards young children left without their parents (see any Disney movie or Harry Potter, for example).  Kids grow up though and as adults they find that, unfortunately, the world we currently live in doesn't readily take to treating everyone equally and that natural adult rights are denied them.  Sexual orientation and gender identity are basic human rights.  If you find the wonderful rainbow spectrum of human sexuality distasteful, that's your hang-up (that I truly hope you get over), but it's not cause to discriminate against other people in your community.  In general, people have a tough time changing their minds, but you must to try to accept the richness of the people that surround you.  Variety is the spice of life!<br/>
      <h3>Is this tax-deductible on my income taxes?</h3>
        While donations are not U.S. tax deductible as charitable contribution, they may be deductible as an operating expense, and if someone is so inclined, they should ask for the advice of their accountant. The same applies to other countries, where corporations can make deductible donations under the terms of "Good Will".  I specifically am not a non-profit organization, as that would limit the nationalities that I could spend such money in.
        <br/>        
      <h3>Business Transparency: how much has the FireFTP project been able to raise over the years?</h3>
      Here's how much support the project has gotten over the years.  Thank you to all who donated over the years - I very much appreciate it!<br><br>
